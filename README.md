## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Freek. I'm a 21 years old guy who enjoys programming, playing videogames, producing music, and taking pictures. Currently attending [Codam Coding College](https://codam.nl/), which is part of the [42 Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(school)).

I've created several projects ever since I started programming in 2015, some larger than others. The biggest one is probably TunePlay, which was a website where you could play music from most platforms (YouTube, Spotify, Soundcloud, Deezer, Mixcloud) using just one interface. I also created [@me_irl_bot](https://www.instagram.com/me.irl.bot) on Instagram, which once had over 200,000 followers (until Instagram deactivated the account and I had to start over in 2019 and 2021 respectively). The source code for most of my projects is open sourced here, on this GitHub profile. Have a look around!
