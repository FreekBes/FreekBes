## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Freek. I'm a guy who enjoys programming (who would have thought!), playing videogames, producing and listening to music, and taking pictures. Currently working as System & Network Administrator for [Codam Coding College](https://codam.nl/), which is part of the [42 Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(school)). I also studied there - if you're interested in what the school's curriculum is like, feel free to refer to my submitted work in the [@fbescodam](https://github.com/fbescodam) organization.


I've created several personal projects ever since I started programming in 2015, some larger than others. The biggest one is probably TunePlay, which was a website where you could play music from most platforms (YouTube, Spotify, Soundcloud, Deezer, Mixcloud) using just one interface. I also created [@me_irl_bot](https://github.com/FreekBes/insta_reddit_bot) on Instagram, which gained over 200,000 followers and roughly 25 million weekly impressions (until Instagram deactivated the account). In 2021, I created [Improved Intra 42](https://github.com/FreekBes/improved_intra), a browser extension that aims to improve the intranet of 42 Network schools by providing more (personalized) features and improving its visuals. It is currently used by over 25% of the active student population.


The source code for _most_ of my projects is open sourced here, on this GitHub profile. Have a look around!

### Programming languages I main
I am proficient in Python, Javascript, PHP, C, Bash, CSS (yes, CSS is not a "real" language, but it is still a valuable skill). I have also worked with C++, Java, Typescript, Go, Ruby, pSQL and probably a bunch of others before. In the end, I believe I can pick up any language and understand its functioning.


### Programming history: my journey through the years

- **<2013:** Broke and fixed many Windows installations and versions, which taught me a lot about this operating system
- **2014:** Started attending a computer science course in high school: learnt binary calculation, Java programming, basic HTML, simplistic "AI" scenarios
- **2015:** Started basic web development: learnt the ins and outs of HTML & CSS
- **2016:** Increased my Javascript skills a lot and combined it with PHP
- **2017:** Won a Lego Mindstorms tournament in high school, by reading the documentation instead of using code (snippets) provided by the school
- **2018:** Discovered the use of APIs, bundled many together into [TunePlay](https://github.com/FreekBes/tuneplay) (a website that played music from various streaming services using the same interface). Started [@me_irl_bot](https://github.com/FreekBes/insta_reddit_bot) on Instagram, which gained over 200.000 followers
- **2019:** Co-founded [a start-up](https://assembl.net/) in Switzerland where I was CTO, which gained the interest of a VC; created a functioning tech demo
- **2020:** Covid-19 disrupted the high school I was working at as IT Assistant. However, I made sure lessons could continue smoothly within 3 days of the school's closure, by creating [a link](https://github.com/damstede/zermelo-google-rooster) between our scheduling software and Google Meet
- **2021:** Started attending Codam Coding College (at the end of 2020) to further increase my programming skills and meet like-minded people
- **2022:** Joined the staff team of Codam Coding College as System and Network Administrator, finished the core curriculum
